#This is a comment
#Variables Vs Constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANT are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

Team1name="We love webtoons"
Team2name="Jahmal"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables strore a value (can chamge)
#Variables cannot start with a number
#E.g 1Teamname="We love webtoons"
#this will cause a syntax error

#Variables cannot have space in the name 
#E.g Team Name= "Jahmal"
#This will cause a syntax error

#This is an example of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The value does not change
